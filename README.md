# Parallel Bitmap-Resampler for Delphi
 High-quality and fast rescaling of VCL- and FMX-bitmaps, including parallel resampling routines.
 Supports Delphi 10.4 and up, probably works for some earlier versions, but untested.
 
 !!! The FMX-version currently supports Windows32Bit and Windows64Bit only !!!
