A simple thumbnail explorer has been added as a demo.
Hopefully fixed possible hang of the threads-in-threads demo

Moved thread setup into a record, makes for some less toxic methods.
Demos allow you to explore changing the radius of the resampler.
Fixed possible error, if only one logical processor is present.
Fixed weights at the boundary of the target bitmap.
