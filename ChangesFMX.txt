  More efficient code for unsharp-mask.

2023-10-2
  New parallel unsharp-mask routine. You can use it in ThreadsInThreadsFMX.dproj for sharpening the thumbs.

  Added Zoom/Pan demo. Thumb size in ThreadsInThreads can be changed (small, medium, large).

  Moved code common to FMX and VCL into a new unit uScaleCommon. This unit needs to be added to the uses-clause together with uScaleFMX. Folders BitmapScaling and BitmapScalingFMX have been merged into one.
  The parallel routines are now all threadsafe, if each thread uses a separate thread-pool. See ThreadsInThreadsFMX in 
Demos\DemosFMX
  Utilities used can now be found in Utilities. There is a brandnew directory-explorer-tree, which is used in ThreadsInThreadsFMX. Please report, if there are issues with it.

  More functionality in DemoScaleFMX: Alpha-combine-modes and zoom-tool.

  First (prototype) version of a port to FMX. 
  Supports Windows platform only, and the thread-pools have not been implemented yet,
so the parallel-threads-routine cannot be used in threads.
  One simple Demo DemoScaleFMX.dproj, which shows basic use.
  Speed with FMX is a bit disappointing.
